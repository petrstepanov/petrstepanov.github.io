üìÖ Jul 2020 - Current

* Applied CERN ROOT framework (C++) to perform statistical analysis of a significant amount (over 100 GB) of the raw experimental data of the [Kaon LT](https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/kltexp/wiki) experiment at JLab. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/kaonlt-fit).
* Utilized SLURM environment on [JLab supercomputer environment](https://scicomp.jlab.org/scicomp/index.html) to run resourceful particle simulations on multiple computing nodes at the same time. This decreased the wall computation time by more than 10 times.
* Proposed and implemented RAMDisk functionality on the development environment. This lead to an over 60% increase in source code indexing time.
* Set up data acquisition system that performs triggered waveform acquisition from Tektronix oscilloscope to a local Network Attached Storage (NAS) device. RedHat, Ethernet, SAMBA, Python, National Instruments VISA library.
* Committed 50+ shifts at the particle accelerator performing Target Operator and Shift Leader duties ([Pion LT project](https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/hall-c/wiki/), experimental Hall C).
