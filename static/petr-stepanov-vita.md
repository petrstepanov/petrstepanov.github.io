Education
---------


### Bowling Green State University (BGSU) ‚Ä¢ OH, United States

üìÖ Aug 2014 - May 2020

Ph.D. in Photochemical Sciences ‚Ä¢ GPA 3.423. [Dissertation](https://petrstepanov.com/static/petr-stepanov-dissertation-latest.pdf): Novel developments in positron spectroscopy (PAS).
* Assembled and utilized two spectrometers: positron lifetime and Doppler. Spectrometers are built from ORTEC and Canberra (Mirion) fast electronic units and utilize High-Purity Germanium Detectors (HPGe) and scintillation-based detector systems.
* Developed open-source software (C++, CERN ROOT) for a novel interpretation of the experimental spectra.
* Defined and resolved kinetic equations of reactions of positron and positronium atoms (Ps) in solids and liquids and nano-powders (Wolfram Mathematica). Equation parameters are implemented in the fitting model of experimental spectra (RooFit).
* Above research allowed for the estimation of defect concentrations and sizes in solids, classification of defect types (vacancies, dislocations), and more...
