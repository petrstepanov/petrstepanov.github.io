### C++ Software Developer

[Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory (JLab)](https://www.jlab.org/), Newport News, VA, USA.

📅 Jul 2020 - Current

* Coded a Geant4-based sumulation for studying the optimal light guide length (range 0-10 cm) for the [EM calorimeter](https://wiki.jlab.org/cuawiki/index.php/Electron-Ion_Collider_Detectors:_EEEMCal) used in the Electron-Ion-Collider (EIC) project. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/light-guides).
* Used Machine Learning (ML) techniques to perform binary classification of thousands of signals from a data acquisition (DAQ) setup. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/dual-readout-tmva).
* Applied CERN ROOT framework (C++) to perform statistical analysis of a significant amount (over 100 GB) of the raw experimental data of the [Kaon LT](https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/kltexp/wiki) experiment at JLab. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/kaonlt-fit).
* Utilized SLURM supercomputer environment to run programs on the JLab supercomputer environment simultaneously. This reduced the wall time by more than 10 times.
* Proposed and implemented RAMDisk functionality on the development environment. This led to an over 50% increase in source code indexing time.
