Work Experience
---------------

### C++ Software Developer
[Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory (JLab)](https://www.jlab.org/), Newport News, VA, USA.

📅 Jul 2020 - Dec 2022

* Coded a Geant4-based sumulation for studying the optimal light guide length (range 0-10 cm) for the [EM calorimeter](https://wiki.jlab.org/cuawiki/index.php/Electron-Ion_Collider_Detectors:_EEEMCal) used in the Electron-Ion-Collider (EIC) project. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/light-guides).
* Used Machine Learning (ML) techniques to perform binary classification of thousands of signals from a data acquisition (DAQ) setup. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/dual-readout-tmva).
* Applied CERN ROOT framework (C++) to perform statistical analysis of a significant amount (over 100 GB) of the raw experimental data of the [Kaon LT](https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/kltexp/wiki) experiment at JLab. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/kaonlt-fit).
* Utilized SLURM functionality on the High-Performance Computing (HPC) environment to execute series of the simulations in parallel. This reduced the wall time by more than 10 times.
* Proposed and implemented RAMDisk functionality on the development environment. This led to an over 50% increase in source code indexing time.

### Software Developer • Postdoctoral Researcher
[Catholic University of America (CUA)](https://www.catholic.edu/index.html), Washington, DC, USA.

📅 Jul 2020 - Dec 2022

* Programmed a Geant-4 computer simulation (C++, CMake, Eclipse IDE, gdb) to study performance of a novel scintillation material for EIC, Brookhaven National Lab. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/geant4-glass).
* Visualized energy deposition profiles and calculated energy resolutions for variety of detector assemblies.
* Enhanced debugging of the core library source code led to the publishing of more than [10 bug reports](https://root-forum.cern.ch/u/petrstepanov/activity/topics) on the ROOT (C++) forum.

### Software Developer • Research Assistant
[Bowling Green State University (BGSU)](https://www.bgsu.edu/), Bowling Green, OH, USA.

📅 Aug 2014 - May 2020

* Wrote three desktop GUI programs for spectra fitting and interpretation (C++, CMake, ROOT, Qt, Java)
  * GitHub repositories contain over 10k lines of code in total: [TLIST Processor](https://github.com/petrstepanov/tlist-processor), [SW Calculator](https://github.com/petrstepanov/sw-calculator), [RooPositron](https://github.com/petrstepanov/roopositron).
  * Extended default ROOT GUI library (Qt-based) to support the MVP design pattern.
* Developed static website (Hexo, Gulp, Bootstrap) and visual identity for the [SelimLab](http://physics.bgsu.edu/selimlab/) research group. The website has a 99% Google performance rank and features 700 ms time to interactive metrics.
* Maintained local Apache HTTP server [physics.bgsu.edu](https://physics.bgsu.edu/) hosting over 10 websites at the BGSU.
* Created website for the [ICPA-18](https://physics.bgsu.edu/icpa18/) international conference with registration (over 150 users) and payment system workflow (WordPress, PHP, Recurly.js), and [landing pages](https://physics.bgsu.edu/IWZnO_2020/index.html) for events.

### Frontend Developer, UI/UX Designer • Freelance

📅 Sep 2012 - May 2020

* Designed and built an online e-commerce store [Sticker Store LLC](https://bimmersticker.store/) with a static website generator (Figma, Hexo, Snipcart, Bootstrap, SASS, Express.JS, EJS, Node.js).
  * Improved the Google PageSpeed Insights metrics (CLS, LCP) up to 97%.
