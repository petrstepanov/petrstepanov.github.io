Work Experience
---------------


### Full-Stack Developer
[Sticker Store LLC](https://stickerstore.llc/), Portland, OR.

📅 Feb 2023 - Current

* Designed and programmed online e-commerce store (Figma, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, Express.JS, EJS, Node.js).
  * Improved the Google PageSpeed Insights metrics (CLS, LCP) up to 97%.
  * Set up low frequency keyword campaign on Google Analytics.
  * Exported local product database to Google Merchant.


### C++ Software Developer
[Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory (JLab)](https://www.jlab.org/), Newport News, VA.

📅 Jul 2020 - Jan 2023

* Coded a Geant4-based simulation for studying the optimal light guide length (range 0-10 cm) for the [EM calorimeter](https://wiki.jlab.org/cuawiki/index.php/Electron-Ion_Collider_Detectors:_EEEMCal) used in the Electron-Ion-Collider (EIC) project. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/light-guides).
* Used Machine Learning (ML) techniques to perform binary classification of thousands of signals from a data acquisition (DAQ) setup. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/dual-readout-tmva).
* Applied CERN ROOT framework (C++) to perform statistical analysis of a significant amount (over 100 GB) of the raw experimental data of the [Kaon LT](https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/kltexp/wiki) experiment at JLab. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/kaonlt-fit).
* Utilized SLURM functionality on the High-Performance Computing (HPC) environment to execute a series of simulations in parallel. This reduced the wall time by more than 10 times.
* Set up data acquisition system that performs triggered waveform acquisition involving 3 devices - Tektronix oscilloscope, Network Attached Storage, and RedHat computer (SAMBA, Python, National Instruments NI-VISA library).
* Contributed 100+ shifts at Hall C at the Thomas Jefferson Particle Accelerator facility for the [Pion LT project](https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/hall-c/wiki/).


### Software Developer • Postdoctoral Researcher
