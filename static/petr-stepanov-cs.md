Work Experience
---------------

### C++ Software Developer

[Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory (JLab)](https://www.jlab.org/), Newport News, VA, USA.

📅 Jul 2020 - Current

* Applied CERN ROOT framework (C++) to perform statistical analysis of a significant amount (over 100 GB) of the raw experimental data of the [Kaon LT](https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/kltexp/wiki) experiment at JLab. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/kaonlt-fit).
* Utilized SLURM environment on [JLab supercomputer environment](https://scicomp.jlab.org/scicomp/index.html) to run resourceful particle simulations on multiple computing nodes at the same time. This decreased the wall computation time by more than 10 times.
* Proposed and implemented RAMDisk functionality on the development environment. This lead to an over 60% increase in source code indexing time.

### Software Developer • Postdoctoral Researcher

[Catholic University of America (CUA)](https://www.catholic.edu/index.html), Washington, DC, USA.

📅 Jul 2020 - Current

* Applied Machine Learning (ML) TMVA framework to perform binary classification of thousands of signals from a data acquisition (DAQ) setup. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/dual-readout-tmva).
* Developed a computer simulation based on the Geant4 framework (C++, CMake, Eclipse IDE, gdb) to study optical properties of a novel scintillation material to be used in the EIC detector system. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/geant4-glass).
    * Program accounts on scintillation material properties - composition, transmittance, luminescence.
    * Code reconstructs detector responce (PMT or MPPC) depending on the quantum efficiency curve.
    * Visualization of optical photon trajectories with respect to their energy or creator process.
* Enhanced debugging of the core library source code lead to opening more than [10 bug reports](https://root-forum.cern.ch/u/petrstepanov/activity/topics) on the ROOT (C++) forum.

### Software Developer • Research Assistant

[Bowling Green State University (BGSU)](https://www.bgsu.edu/), Bowling Green, OH, USA.

📅 Aug 2014 - May 2020

* Wrote three desktop GUI programs for spectra fitting and interpretation (C++, CMake, ROOT, Qt, Java)
    * GitHub repositories contain over 10k lines of code in total: [TLIST Processor](https://github.com/petrstepanov/tlist-processor), [SW Calculator](https://github.com/petrstepanov/sw-calculator), [RooPositron](https://github.com/petrstepanov/roopositron).
    * Technologies used: CMake, C++, ROOT, Fox GUI and RooFit libraries.
    * Extended default ROOT GUI library (Qt-based) to support the MVP design pattern.
* Wrote a GUI application [LuminApp](https://github.com/petrstepanov/luminapp) (Java, Swing) to parse and merge time-stamped data from optical spectrometer and thermometer. This increased data processing time by two orders of magnitude.
* Developed static website (Hexo, Gulp, Bootstrap) and visual identity for the [SelimLab](http://physics.bgsu.edu/selimlab/) research group. Website has a 99% Google performance rank and features 700 ms time to interactive metrics.
* Maintained local Apache HTTP server [physics.bgsu.edu](https://physics.bgsu.edu/) hosting over 10 websites at the BGSU.
* Created website for the [ICPA-18](https://physics.bgsu.edu/icpa18/) international conference with registration (over 150 users) and payment system workflow (WordPress, PHP, Recurly.js), and [landing pages](https://physics.bgsu.edu/IWZnO_2020/index.html) for events.

### Frontend Developer, UI/UX Designer • Freelance
