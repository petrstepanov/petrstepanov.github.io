Summary of Qualifications
-------------------------

* More than 7 years of experience in GUI desktop software development for data analysis and statistics (C++, ROOT, Qt, Java, Python).
* Solid background in Geant4 particle simulations software. Developed Geant4-based programs for applications in high-energy physics and photonics research (EIC, NPS).
* Experience with delivering production ready software for the High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments.
* Strong materials science skills. Defect characterization, porosity studies in bulk materials (with crystal structure and nano-powders).
* Over 5 years of hands-on experience with data acquisition setups and numerous fast electronic modules (ORTEC, Canberra, Tektronix).


Work Experience
---------------

### Research Collaborator (On-Site)
[Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory (JLab)](https://www.jlab.org/), Newport News, VA, USA.

📅 Jul 2020 - Dec 2022

* Coded a Geant4-based sumulation for studying the optimal light guide length (range 0-10 cm) for the [EM calorimeter](https://wiki.jlab.org/cuawiki/index.php/Electron-Ion_Collider_Detectors:_EEEMCal) used in the Electron-Ion-Collider (EIC) project. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/light-guides).
* Used Machine Learning (ML) techniques to perform binary classification of thousands of signals from a data acquisition (DAQ) setup. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/dual-readout-tmva).
* Applied CERN ROOT framework (C++) to perform statistical analysis of a significant amount (over 100 GB) of the raw experimental data of the [Kaon LT](https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/kltexp/wiki) experiment at JLab. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/kaonlt-fit).
* Utilized SLURM functionality on the High-Performance Computing (HPC) environment to execute series of the simulations in parallel. This reduced the wall time by more than 10 times.
* Proposed and implemented RAMDisk functionality on the development environment. This led to an over 50% increase in source code indexing time.
* Set up data acquisition system that performs triggered waveform acquisition involving 3 devices - Tektronix oscilloscope, Network Attached Storage, and RedHat computer (SAMBA, Python, National Instruments NI-VISA library).
* Contributed 100+ shifts at the Hall C in Thomas Jefferson Particle Accelerator facility for the [Pion LT project](https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/hall-c/wiki/).

### Postdoctoral Researcher (Remote)
[Catholic University of America (CUA)](https://www.catholic.edu/index.html), Washington, DC, USA.

📅 Jul 2020 - Dec 2022

* Programmed a Geant-4 computer simulation (C++, CMake, Eclipse IDE, gdb) to study performance of a novel scintillation material for EIC, Brookhaven National Lab. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/geant4-glass).
* Visualized energy deposition profiles and calculated energy resolutions for variety of detector assemblies.
* Teaching experience. Mentoring students within a 3-month Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at the Physics Department at CUA. Giving talks and presentations about [Linux Terminal](https://petrstepanov.com/static/presentations/presentation-2021-06-03-linux-terminal.pdf), and [supercomputer environment](https://petrstepanov.com/static/presentations/presentation-2021-06-17-jlab-geant-root.pdf).
* Enhanced debugging of the core library source code led to the publishing of more than [10 bug reports](https://root-forum.cern.ch/u/petrstepanov/activity/topics) on the ROOT (C++) forum.

### Research Assistant
[Bowling Green State University (BGSU)](https://www.bgsu.edu/), Bowling Green, OH, USA.

📅 Aug 2014 - May 2020

* Assembled positron lifetime and Doppler spectrometers from ORTEC and Canberra (Mirion) fast electronic units. Utilized High-Purity Germanium Detectors (HPGe) and scintillation-based detector systems for single-photon counting.
* Developed three open-source programs (C++, CERN ROOT) for a novel interpretation of the positron lifetime and Doppler experimental spectra.
  * Derived and solved kinetic equations describing the formation and chemical reactions of e+ and Ps atoms in solids, liquids, and nano-powders (Wolfram Mathematica).
  * Incorporated physical parameters (grain size, defect concentrations, rate constants) into custom models (PDFs with convolution) for fitting of the experimental spectra (RooFit).
* Above research allowed for estimation of defect concentrations and sizes in solids, classification of defect types (vacancies, dislocations) and characterization of the chemical decoration of defects.
* Wrote a GUI application [LuminApp](https://github.com/petrstepanov/luminapp) (Java, Swing) to parse and merge time-stamped data from optical spectrometer and thermometer. This increased data processing time by two orders of magnitude.
* Developed static website (Hexo, Gulp, Bootstrap) and visual identity for the [SelimLab](http://physics.bgsu.edu/selimlab/) research group. The website has a 99% Google performance rank and features 700 ms time to interactive metrics.
