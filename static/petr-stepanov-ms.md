Summary of Qualifications
-------------------------


* Two years of experience with GEANT4 particle simulation software. Developed a program for photonics research (classification of scintillation materials) for the EIC project. 
* Applied positron lifetime and Doppler spectroscopy techniques for defect characterization in bulk materials with crystal structure, nano-powders and liquids.

Work Experience
---------------

### Research Collaborator (On-Site)

[Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory (JLab)](https://www.jlab.org/), Newport News, VA, USA.

üìÖ Jul 2020 - Current

* Applied CERN ROOT framework (C++) to perform statistical analysis of a significant amount (over 100 GB) of the raw experimental data of the [Kaon LT](https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/kltexp/wiki) experiment at JLab. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/kaonlt-fit).
* Utilized SLURM environment on [JLab supercomputer environment](https://scicomp.jlab.org/scicomp/index.html) to run resourceful particle simulations on multiple computing nodes at the same time. This decreased the wall computation time by more than 10 times.
* Proposed and implemented RAMDisk functionality on the development environment. This lead to an over 60% increase in source code indexing time.
* Set up data acquisition system that performs triggered waveform acquisition from Tektronix oscilloscope to a local Network Attached Storage (NAS) device. RedHat, Ethernet, SAMBA, Python, National Instruments VISA library.
* Committed 50+ shifts at the particle accelerator performing Target Operator and Shift Leader duties ([Pion LT project](https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/hall-c/wiki/), experimental Hall C).

### Postdoctoral Researcher (Remote)

[Catholic University of America (CUA)](https://www.catholic.edu/index.html), Washington, DC, USA.

üìÖ Jul 2020 - Current

* Applied Machine Learning (ML) TMVA framework to perform binary classification of thousands of signals from a data acquisition (DAQ) setup. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/dual-readout-tmva).
* Developed a computer simulation based on the Geant4 framework (C++, CMake, Eclipse IDE, gdb) to study optical properties of a novel scintillation material to be used in the EIC detector system. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/geant4-glass).
    * Program accounts on scintillation material properties - composition, transmittance, luminescence.
    * Code reconstructs detector responce (PMT or MPPC) depending on the quantum efficiency curve.
    * Visualization of optical photon trajectories with respect to their energy or creator process.
* Teaching experience. Mentoring students within a 3-month Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at the Physics Department at CUA. Giving talks and presentations about [Linux Terminal](https://petrstepanov.com/static/presentations/presentation-2021-06-03-linux-terminal.pdf), and [supercomputer environment](https://petrstepanov.com/static/presentations/presentation-2021-06-17-jlab-geant-root.pdf).
* Enhanced debugging of the core library source code lead to opening more than [10 bug reports](https://root-forum.cern.ch/u/petrstepanov/activity/topics) on the ROOT (C++) forum.

### Research Assistant

[Bowling Green State University (BGSU)](https://www.bgsu.edu/), Bowling Green, OH, USA.

üìÖ Aug 2014 - May 2020

* Assembled positron lifetime and Doppler from ORTEC and Canberra (Mirion) fast electronic units. Utilized High-Purity Germanium Detectors (HPGe) and scintillation-based detector systems for single-photon detection.
* Developed three open-source programs (C++, CERN ROOT) for novel interpretation of the positron lifetime and Doppler experimental spectra.
    * Outlined and resolved kinetic equations of reactions of positron and positronium atoms (Ps) for 3 types of materials: solids, liquids and nano-powders (Wolfram Mathemetica).
    * Incorporated physical parameters (grain size, defect concentrations, rate constants) into complex fitting models with convolution for interpretation of the experimental spectra (RooFit).
* Above research allowed for estimation of defect concentrations and sizes in solids, classification of defect types (vacancies, dislocations) and characterization of the chemical environment of the defect spots.
* Wrote a GUI application [LuminApp](https://github.com/petrstepanov/luminapp) (Java, Swing) to parse and merge time-stamped data from optical spectrometer and thermometer. This increased data processing time by two orders of magnitude.
* Developed static website (Hexo, Gulp, Bootstrap) and visual identity for the [SelimLab](http://physics.bgsu.edu/selimlab/) research group. Website has a 99% Google performance rank and features 700 ms time to interactive metrics.
