Summary
-------

Ph.D. graduate with expertise in gamma spectroscopy, positron annihilation spectroscopy, microscopy, and nuclear physics. Strong background in computational techniques: data anayysis, particle simulations, software development (desktop and web applications).

Graduated from [BGSU](https://www.bgsu.edu/) in May 2020. Seeking to become an effective member of a research group in the industry. Authorized to work in the US on [Optional Practical Training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optional_Practical_Training) (OPT) in physics, chemistry, and computer science. OPT expires in February 2023. Will consider visa sponsorship offers.
