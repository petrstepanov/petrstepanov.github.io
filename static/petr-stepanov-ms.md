Work Experience
---------------

### Research Collaborator (On-Site)

[Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory (JLab)](https://www.jlab.org/), Newport News, VA, USA.

üìÖ July 2020 - Current

* Applied CERN ROOT framework (C++) to perform statistical analysis of a significant amount (over 100 GB) of the raw experimental data of the [Kaon LT](https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/kltexp/wiki) experiment at JLab. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/kaonlt-fit).
* Utilized SLURM environment on [JLab supercomputer environment](https://scicomp.jlab.org/scicomp/index.html) to run resourceful particle simulations on multiple computing nodes at the same time. This decreased the wall computation time by more than 10 times.
* Proposed and implemented RAMDisk functionality on the development environment. This lead to an over 60% increase in source code indexing time.
* Set up data acquisition system that performs triggered waveform acquisition from Tektronix oscilloscope to a local Network Attached Storage (NAS) device. RedHat, Ethernet, SAMBA, Python, National Instruments VISA library.
* Active collaborator of the [Pion LT project](https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/hall-c/wiki/). Committed more than 50 shifts performing Target Operator and Shift Leader duties in the experimental Hall C counting room.

### Postdoctoral Researcher (Remote)

[Catholic University of America (CUA)](https://www.catholic.edu/index.html), Washington, DC, USA.

üìÖ July 2020 - Current

* Applied Machine Learning (ML) TMVA framework to perform binary classification of thousands of signals from a data acquisition (DAQ) setup. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/dual-readout-tmva).
* Developed a computer simulation based on the Geant4 framework (C++, CMake, Eclipse IDE, gdb) to study optical properties of a novel scintillation material to be used in the EIC detector system. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/geant4-glass).
* Teaching experience: mentoring students within a 3-month Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at the Physics Department at CUA. Giving talks and presentations about [Linux Terminal](https://petrstepanov.com/static/presentations/presentation-2021-06-03-linux-terminal.pdf), and [supercomputer environment](https://petrstepanov.com/static/presentations/presentation-2021-06-17-jlab-geant-root.pdf).
* Enhanced debugging of the core library source code lead to opening more than [10 bug reports](https://root-forum.cern.ch/u/petrstepanov/activity/topics) on the ROOT (C++) forum.

### Research Assistant

[Bowling Green State University (BGSU)](https://www.bgsu.edu/), Bowling Green, OH, USA.

üìÖ August 2014 - May 2020

* Applied ROOT C++ libraries to write three GUI open-source software for scientific data interpretation.
    * GitHub repositories contain over 10k lines of code in total: [TLIST Processor](https://github.com/petrstepanov/tlist-processor), [SW Calculator](https://github.com/petrstepanov/sw-calculator), [RooPositron](https://github.com/petrstepanov/roopositron).
    * Technologies used: CMake, C++, ROOT, Fox GUI and RooFit libraries.
    * Extended default ROOT GUI library (Qt-based) to support the MVP design pattern.
* Wrote a GUI application [LuminApp](https://github.com/petrstepanov/luminapp) (Java, Swing) to parse and merge time-stamped data from optical spectrometer and thermometer. This increased data processing time by two orders of magnitude.
