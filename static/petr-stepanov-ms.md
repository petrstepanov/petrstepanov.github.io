Work Experience
---------------


### Full-Stack Developer
[Sticker Store LLC](https://stickerstore.llc/), Portland, OR.

📅 Feb 2023 - Current

* Designed and programmed online e-commerce store (Figma, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, Express.JS, EJS, Node.js).
  * Improved the Google PageSpeed Insights metrics (CLS, LCP) up to 97%.
  * Set up low frequency keyword campaign on Google Analytics.
  * Exported local product database to Google Merchant.


### Research Collaborator (On-Site)
[Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory (JLab)](https://www.jlab.org/), Newport News, VA.

📅 Jul 2020 - Jan 2023

* Coded a Geant4-based simulation for studying the optimal light guide length (range 0-10 cm) for the [EM calorimeter](https://wiki.jlab.org/cuawiki/index.php/Electron-Ion_Collider_Detectors:_EEEMCal) used in the Electron-Ion-Collider (EIC) project. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/light-guides).
* Used Machine Learning (ML) techniques to perform binary classification of thousands of signals from a data acquisition (DAQ) setup. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/dual-readout-tmva).
* Applied CERN ROOT framework (C++) to perform statistical analysis of a significant amount (over 100 GB) of the raw experimental data of the [Kaon LT](https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/kltexp/wiki) experiment at JLab. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/kaonlt-fit).
* Utilized SLURM functionality on the High-Performance Computing (HPC) environment to execute a series of simulations in parallel. This reduced the wall time by more than 10 times.
* Set up data acquisition system that performs triggered waveform acquisition involving 3 devices - Tektronix oscilloscope, Network Attached Storage, and RedHat computer (SAMBA, Python, National Instruments NI-VISA library).
* Contributed 100+ shifts at Hall C at the Thomas Jefferson Particle Accelerator facility for the [Pion LT project](https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/hall-c/wiki/).


### Postdoctoral Researcher (Remote)
[Catholic University of America (CUA)](https://www.catholic.edu/index.html), Washington, DC.

📅 Jul 2020 - Jan 2023

* Programmed a Geant-4 computer simulation (C++, CMake, Eclipse IDE, gdb) to study the performance of a novel scintillation material for EIC, Brookhaven National Lab. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/geant4-glass).
* Visualized energy deposition profiles and calculated energy resolutions for a variety of detector assemblies.
* Teaching experience. Mentoring students within a 3-month Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at the Physics Department at CUA.
* Enhanced debugging of the CERN library source code led to the publishing of more than [10 bug reports](https://root-forum.cern.ch/u/petrstepanov/activity/topics) on the ROOT (C++) forum.


### Research Assistant
[Bowling Green State University (BGSU)](https://www.bgsu.edu/), Bowling Green, OH.

📅 Aug 2014 - May 2020

* Assembled positron lifetime and Doppler spectrometers from ORTEC and Canberra (Mirion) fast electronic units. Utilized High-Purity Germanium Detectors (HPGe) and scintillation-based detector systems for single-photon counting.
* Defined and resolved novel kinetic equations of behavior of e+ and Ps atoms in solids, liquids, and nano-powders (Wolfram Mathematica).
* Developed three open-source programs (C++, CERN ROOT) for fitting and interpretation of the experimental spectra for above data acquisition systems (DAQ).
* Combination of the hardware and software skills allowed for:
  * Estimation of defect concentrations and grain sizes in solids.
  * Classification of defect types (vacancies, dislocations).
  * Characterization of the chemical decoration of defects.
* Developed website (Express.js, Gulp, Bootstrap) and visual identity for the [SelimLab](http://physics.bgsu.edu/selimlab/) research group.
