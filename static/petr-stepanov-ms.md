Work Experience
---------------


### Research Collaborator (On-Site)
[Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory (JLab)](https://www.jlab.org/), Newport News, VA.

📅 Jul 2020 - Jan 2023

* Coded a Geant4-based simulation for studying the optimal light guide length (range 0-10 cm) for the [EM calorimeter](https://wiki.jlab.org/cuawiki/index.php/Electron-Ion_Collider_Detectors:_EEEMCal) used in the Electron-Ion-Collider (EIC) project. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/light-guides).
* Used Machine Learning (ML) techniques to perform binary classification of thousands of signals from a data acquisition (DAQ) setup. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/dual-readout-tmva).
* Applied CERN ROOT framework (C++) to perform statistical analysis of a significant amount (over 100 GB) of the raw experimental data of the [Kaon LT](https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/kltexp/wiki) experiment at JLab. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/kaonlt-fit).
* Utilized SLURM functionality on the High-Performance Computing (HPC) environment to execute a series of simulations in parallel. This reduced the wall time by more than 10 times.
* Set up data acquisition system that performs triggered waveform acquisition involving 3 devices - Tektronix oscilloscope, Network Attached Storage, and RedHat computer (SAMBA, Python, National Instruments NI-VISA library).
* Contributed 100+ shifts at Hall C at the Thomas Jefferson Particle Accelerator facility for the [Pion LT project](https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/hall-c/wiki/).


### Postdoctoral Researcher (Remote)
[Catholic University of America (CUA)](https://www.catholic.edu/index.html), Washington, DC.

📅 Jul 2020 - Jan 2023

* Programmed a Geant-4 computer simulation (C++, CMake, Eclipse IDE, gdb) to study the performance of a novel scintillation material for EIC, Brookhaven National Lab. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/geant4-glass).
* Visualized energy deposition profiles and calculated energy resolutions for a variety of detector assemblies.
* Teaching experience. Mentoring students within a 3-month Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at the Physics Department at CUA.
* Enhanced debugging of the CERN library source code led to the publishing of more than [10 bug reports](https://root-forum.cern.ch/u/petrstepanov/activity/topics) on the ROOT (C++) forum.


### Research Assistant
[Bowling Green State University (BGSU)](https://www.bgsu.edu/), Bowling Green, OH.

📅 Aug 2014 - May 2020

* Assembled positron lifetime and Doppler spectrometers from ORTEC and Canberra (Mirion) fast electronic units. Utilized High-Purity Germanium Detectors (HPGe) and scintillation-based detector systems for single-photon counting.
* Developed three open-source programs (C++, CERN ROOT) for a novel interpretation of the positron lifetime and Doppler experimental spectra.
  * Derived and solved kinetic equations describing the formation and chemical reactions of e+ and Ps atoms in solids, liquids, and nano-powders (Wolfram Mathematica).
  * Incorporated physical parameters (grain size, defect concentrations, rate constants) into custom models (PDFs with convolution) for fitting the experimental spectra (RooFit).
* The above research allowed for the estimation of defect concentrations and sizes in solids, classification of defect types (vacancies, dislocations), and characterization of the chemical decoration of defects.
* Wrote three desktop GUI programs for spectra fitting and interpretation (C++, CMake, ROOT, Qt, Java)
  * GitHub repositories contain over 10k lines of code in total: [TLIST Processor](https://github.com/petrstepanov/tlist-processor), [SW Calculator](https://github.com/petrstepanov/sw-calculator), [RooPositron](https://github.com/petrstepanov/roopositron).
  * Extended default ROOT GUI library (Qt-based) to support the MVP design pattern.
* Wrote a GUI application [LuminApp](https://github.com/petrstepanov/luminapp) (Java, Swing) to parse and merge time-stamped data from optical spectrometer and thermometer. This increased data processing time by two orders of magnitude.
* Developed static website (Hexo, Gulp, Bootstrap) and visual identity for the [SelimLab](http://physics.bgsu.edu/selimlab/) research group. The website has a 99% Google performance rank and features 700 ms time to interactive metrics.
* Maintained local Apache HTTP server [physics.bgsu.edu](https://physics.bgsu.edu/) hosting over 10 websites at the BGSU.
* Created website for the [ICPA-18](https://physics.bgsu.edu/icpa18/) international conference with registration (over 150 users) and payment system workflow (WordPress, PHP, Recurly.js), and [landing pages](https://physics.bgsu.edu/IWZnO_2020/index.html) for events.
