Summary
-------

Ph.D. graduate with expertise in gamma spectroscopy, positron annihilation spectroscopy, microscopy, and nuclear physics. Strong background in computational techniques: data anayysis, particle simulations, software development (desktop and web applications).

Graduated from [BGSU](https://www.bgsu.edu/) in May 2020. Seeking to become an effective member of a research group in the industry. Authorized to work in the US on [Optional Practical Training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optional_Practical_Training) (OPT) in physics, chemistry, and computer science. OPT expires in February 2023. Will consider visa sponsorship offers.

Work Experience
---------------


### Research Collaborator (On-Site)

[Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab)](https://www.jlab.org/) *Jul 2020 - Current*


* Applied CERN ROOT framework (C++) to perform statistical analysis of a significant amount (over 100 GB) of the raw experimental data of the [Kaon LT](https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/kltexp/wiki) experiment at JLab. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/kaonlt-fit).

* Utilized SLURM environment on [JLab supercomputer environment](https://scicomp.jlab.org/scicomp/index.html) to run resourceful particle simulations on multiple computing nodes at the same time. This decreased the wall computation time by more than 10 times.

* Proposed and implemented RAMDisk functionality on the development environment. This lead to an over 60% increase in source code indexing time.

* Set up data acquisition system that performs triggered waveform acquisition from Tektronix oscilloscope to a local Network Attached Storage (NAS) device. RedHat, Ethernet, SAMBA, Python, National Instruments VISA library.

* Active collaborator of the [Pion LT project](https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/hall-c/wiki/). Committed more than 50 shifts performing Target Operator and Shift Leader duties in the experimental Hall C counting room.



### Postdoctoral Researcher (Remote)

[Catholic University of America (CUA)](https://www.catholic.edu/index.html) *Jul 2020 - Current*


* Applied Machine Learning (ML) TMVA framework to perform binary classification of thousands of signals from a data acquisition (DAQ) setup. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/dual-readout-tmva).

* Developed a computer simulation based on the Geant4 framework (C++, CMake, Eclipse IDE, gdb) to study optical properties of a novel scintillation material to be used in the EIC detector system. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/geant4-glass).

* Teaching experience: mentoring students within a 3-month Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at the Physics Department at CUA. Giving talks and presentations about [Linux Terminal](https://petrstepanov.com/static/presentations/presentation-2021-06-03-linux-terminal.pdf), and [supercomputer environment](https://petrstepanov.com/static/presentations/presentation-2021-06-17-jlab-geant-root.pdf).

* Enhanced debugging of the core library source code lead to opening more than [10 bug reports](https://root-forum.cern.ch/u/petrstepanov/activity/topics) on the ROOT (C++) forum.
