  description:
    - Applied CERN ROOT framework (C++) to perform statistical analysis of a significant amount (over 100 GB) of the raw experimental data of the [Kaon LT](https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/kltexp/wiki) experiment at JLab. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/kaonlt-fit).
    - Utilized SLURM environment on [JLab supercomputer environment](https://scicomp.jlab.org/scicomp/index.html) to run resourceful particle simulations on multiple computing nodes at the same time. This decreased the wall computation time by more than 10 times.
    - Proposed and implemented RAMDisk functionality on the development environment. This lead to an over 60% increase in source code indexing time.
    - Set up data acquisition system that performs triggered waveform acquisition from Tektronix oscilloscope to a local Network Attached Storage (NAS) device. RedHat, Ethernet, SAMBA, Python, National Instruments VISA library.
    - Active collaborator of the [Pion LT project](https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/hall-c/wiki/). Committed more than 50 shifts performing Target Operator and Shift Leader duties in the experimental Hall C counting room.

  description:
    - Applied Machine Learning (ML) TMVA framework to perform binary classification of thousands of signals from a data acquisition (DAQ) setup. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/dual-readout-tmva).
    - Developed a computer simulation based on the Geant4 framework (C++, CMake, Eclipse IDE, gdb) to study optical properties of a novel scintillation material to be used in the EIC detector system. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/geant4-glass).
    - "Teaching experience: mentoring students within a 3-month Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at the Physics Department at CUA. Giving talks and presentations about [Linux Terminal](https://petrstepanov.com/static/presentations/presentation-2021-06-03-linux-terminal.pdf), and [supercomputer environment](https://petrstepanov.com/static/presentations/presentation-2021-06-17-jlab-geant-root.pdf)."
    - Enhanced debugging of the core library source code lead to opening more than [10 bug reports](https://root-forum.cern.ch/u/petrstepanov/activity/topics) on the ROOT (C++) forum.
