    - <ms cs> Coded a Geant4-based sumulation for studying the optimal light guide length (range 0-10 cm) for the [EM calorimeter](https://wiki.jlab.org/cuawiki/index.php/Electron-Ion_Collider_Detectors:_EEEMCal) used in the Electron-Ion-Collider (EIC) project. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/light-guides).
    - <ms cs> Used Machine Learning (ML) techniques to perform binary classification of thousands of signals from a data acquisition (DAQ) setup. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/dual-readout-tmva).
    - <ms cs> Applied CERN ROOT framework (C++) to perform statistical analysis of a significant amount (over 100 GB) of the raw experimental data of the [Kaon LT](https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/kltexp/wiki) experiment at JLab. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/petrstepanov/kaonlt-fit).
    - <ms cs> Utilized SLURM functionality on the High-Performance Computing (HPC) environment to execute series of the simulations in parallel. This reduced the wall time by more than 10 times.
    - <ms> Set up data acquisition system that performs triggered waveform acquisition involving 3 devices - Tektronix oscilloscope, Network Attached Storage, and RedHat computer (SAMBA, Python, National Instruments NI-VISA library).
    - <ms> Contributed 100+ shifts at the Hall C in Thomas Jefferson Particle Accelerator facility for the [Pion LT project](https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/hall-c/wiki/).
