  info: "[Dissertation](https://petrstepanov.com/static/petr-stepanov-dissertation-latest.pdf): Novel developments in positron spectroscopy (PAS)."
  description:
    - "Assembled and utilized two spectrometers: positron lifetime and Doppler. Spectrometers are built from ORTEC and Canberra (Mirion) fast electronic units and utilize High-Purity Germanium Detectors (HPGe) and scintillation-based detector systems."
    - Developed open-source software (C++, CERN ROOT) for a novel interpretation of the experimental spectra.
    - Defined and resolved kinetic equations of reactions of positron and positronium atoms (Ps) in solids and liquids and nano-powders (Wolfram Mathematica). Equation parameters are implemented in the fitting model of experimental spectra (RooFit).
    - Above research allowed for the estimation of defect concentrations and sizes in solids, classification of defect types (vacancies, dislocations), and more...
